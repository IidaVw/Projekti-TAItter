        <h2>How we got inspired</h2>
        <p>TAItter was born from a simple observation: social media had become overwhelming and impersonal. Our founders noticed how people spent hours scrolling through feeds filled with content they didn't care about, missing the posts that truly mattered to them.</p>
        <p>We asked ourselves: what if artificial intelligence could help solve this problem? What if we could create a platform that understood your interests and brought relevant content directly to you?</p>
        <p>Drawing inspiration from the best aspects of traditional social networks while addressing their shortcomings, we set out to build something different. A platform where AI serves as your personal content curator, not a barrier to authentic connection.</p>
        <p>After months of development and testing with early users, TAItter emerged as a solution that balances the efficiency of AI with the warmth of human interaction. Every feature we build is designed with one question in mind: does this help our users connect better?</p>
